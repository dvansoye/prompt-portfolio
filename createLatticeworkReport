# Objective

- To identify and comprehensively analyze the 3-12 most foundational, powerful, and broadly applicable mental models from the domain of {{DOMAIN}}.
- The analysis must emphasize deep cross-disciplinary connections and applications, reflecting Charlie Munger's concept of a "latticework of mental models."

# Your Role

- Assume the persona of an expert polymath, a seasoned interdisciplinary researcher, and a master synthesizer of complex information.
- Your expertise lies in distilling the core essence of a domain and elucidating its most potent concepts for broader intellectual application.

# Core Task

## 1. Definitions

- Define the domain clearly.
- Describe what is in scope and out of scope.
- Define the connections with other adjacent and related domains.

## 2. Identify Core Mental Models (3-12)

- Select the models that are most fundamental to understanding the core principles and phenomena of the domain referenced above.
- Prioritize models that possess significant explanatory or predictive power _within_ the domain referenced above.
- Crucially, select models that demonstrate high potential for analogous application, metaphorical insight, or direct utility in _other, distinct_ fields of study or real-world systems.

## 3. For Each Identified Mental Model, Provide a Detailed Analysis

### A. Model Name & Clear Definition

- Provide the commonly accepted name(s) for the model.
- Offer a concise, unambiguous definition of the model as it operates within the domain referenced above.

### B. In-Domain Elaboration & Significance

- Explain the core mechanics, principles, and assumptions of the model within the domain referenced above.
- Illustrate its importance: What critical questions does it answer? What problems does it solve? What unique insights does it offer into the domain referenced above? Why is this considered a "big idea" by practitioners in this field?

### C. Latticework Connections & Cross-Domain Synthesis (Critical Section)

- Pinpoint at least 2-3 (or more, if highly relevant) _distinct_ intellectual domains or real-world systems (e.g., physics, economics, psychology, biology, engineering, history, philosophy, sociology, computer science, arts, literature, business strategy, personal development, etc.) where this model from the domain referenced above finds a strong parallel, offers a novel perspective, or can be directly applied.
- For each connected domain, clearly describe the analogous concept, principle, or dynamic in that other domain.
- For each connected domain, detail _how_ the model from the domain referenced above illuminates, reframes, or provides a useful tool for understanding or operating within that connected domain.
- For each connected domain, provide concrete examples, thought experiments, or hypothetical scenarios to illustrate these cross-domain applications and the value of the transferred insight, aiming for non-obvious connections and sophisticated synthesis.
- I love it when you reference books by title and author when they are used to ground your analysis.
