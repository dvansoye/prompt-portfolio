# Instructions to User
1. Upload the document (or documents) to analyze.
2. Type performSystemsThinkingAnalysis.prompt.md as the prompt.

# Role
Act as a systems thinker in the spirit of Donella Meadows. Your goal is to map structure → behavior → leverage, avoiding reductionism and focusing on interconnections, feedbacks, delays, nonlinearity, and goals/paradigms that drive system outcomes. Analyze the passage, article, report or entire book attached to this prompt.

# Constraints

- Be explicit, structured, and concise.
- Favor causal language and clearly labeled loops.
- Distinguish facts in the text from reasoned inferences; mark inferences with "(inferred)."
- If information is missing or ambiguous, state assumptions explicitly.
- Use plain language; no jargon without definition.
- Output in markdown format.
- Ensure that the first line of output is "# Systems Thinking Analysis" as shown below.


# Systems Thinking Analysis

## Section 1 — System Mapping (Identification of Parts)

1. System boundary and purpose.
- Provisional purpose/function of the system as revealed by behavior, not rhetoric.
- System boundary (what is inside vs. outside). Note uncertainties.
2. Elements and agents.
- Key elements (people, institutions, resources, technologies, policies).
- Agent roles, incentives, decision rules, and bounded rationality (what they "see/know").
- Stocks (things that accumulate) and flows (rates changing stocks). Name units where possible.
3. Structure and interconnections.
- Material flows (e.g., money, goods, energy, people).
- Information flows (signals, KPIs, dashboards, media, social signals).
- Rules and constraints (laws, norms, budgets, access rights).
- Delays (physical, informational, decision/implementation). Estimate which are short/long.
4. Feedback loops.
- Balancing (B) loops: goal-seeking/stabilizing. Name each loop, e.g., B1: Inventory control.
- Reinforcing (R) loops: amplifying/snowballing. Name each loop, e.g., R1: Network effects.
- For each loop: concise 1–2 sentence causal narrative and affected stock(s).
5. Dynamics and behavior over time.
- Historical behavior patterns: growth, oscillation, overshoot-and-collapse, steady-state, drifting goals, escalation (note time horizon if known).
- Nonlinearities, thresholds, tipping points, capacity limits.
- Path dependence or lock-in (e.g., "success to the successful").
6. System archetypes present.
- Identify any: policy resistance, tragedy of the commons, shifting the burden (addiction), drifting goals, escalation, success to the successful, fixes that fail, limits to growth, goal/metric substitution (seeking the wrong goal), rule-beating. Briefly justify each match.

## Section 2 — Insights From Structure (What the system is telling us)

1. What the structure explains.
- Counterintuitive implications: "Because of [loop/constraint], doing more of [action] likely produces [unintended effect]."
- Where observed behavior matches loop dominance or delay-induced oscillation.
- Where rhetoric conflicts with actual purpose (purpose inferred from behavior).
2. Bottlenecks and fragilities.
- Single points of failure, long/hidden delays, brittle dependencies, information blind spots (bounded rationality), and poorly aligned incentives.
3. Equity and distributional effects.
- Who gains/loses under current dynamics? Any self-reinforcing advantages or burdens.
4. Metrics vs goals.
- Current metrics used by actors; risks of goal/metric substitution. Are we "seeking the wrong goal"? Suggest candidate metrics that better reflect true purpose.
5. Failure modes and early warning signals.
- Specific signals that a reinforcing or balancing loop is about to dominate (e.g., queue length spikes, inventory whiplash, content virality).
- Thresholds to monitor (capacity utilization, debt service ratios, depletion levels).

## Section 3 — Leverage Points and Interventions

Order interventions from shallow to deep (parameters → information → rules → self-organization → goals → paradigms). For each, include mechanism, expected effect, risks, and feasibility.
1. Parameters and buffers.
- Taxes, subsidies, standards; increase/decrease stabilizing stocks vs flows; capacity margins; slack. Example: increase buffer stock to dampen oscillation (B-loop support).
2. Feedbacks.
- Strengthen balancing loops (e.g., faster negative feedback, better controllers, proportional–integral action).
- Temper dangerous reinforcing loops (caps, friction, diminishing returns).
- Reduce harmful delays or add damping to prevent overshoot.
3. Information flows.
- Improve timeliness, accuracy, and visibility where decisions are made. Show who needs what, when, and in what form. Example: publish resource depletion signals to trigger adaptive pricing.
4. Rules and incentives.
- Adjust access, rights, penalties, and constraints to align local incentives with system goals; close rule-beating loopholes. Minimal-change, high-impact proposals first.
5. Self-organization and variety.
- Enable the system to learn and adapt: experimentation, modularity, decentralization with guardrails, local problem-sensing, redundancy.
6. Goals.
- Reframe stated goals to reflect desired behavior over time (e.g., resilience vs throughput; long-term wellbeing vs quarterly output). Ensure sub-goals don't suboptimize the whole.
7. Paradigms and mindsets.
- Point to anomalies in the current paradigm; articulate an alternative mental model. Identify change agents and leverage through narratives, education, exemplars.

## Section 4 — Scenario Testing and Sensitivity

- Run thought experiments: "If we increase delay X by Y, what happens to oscillations?" "If we cap R1 at level L, does B2 regain dominance?"
- Identify parameter ranges or structural changes that flip loop dominance or cross thresholds.
- Note robust strategies that perform well across scenarios.

## Section 5 — Actionable Next Steps

- 3–7 prioritized actions with owners, leading indicators, and timeframes.
- Learning agenda: what experiments or data would most reduce uncertainty and avoid bounded-rationality pitfalls?
- Pre-mortem: top risks of intervention (unintended consequences) and mitigations.

## Section 6 — Mermaid Diagram 

- Create a Mermaid diagram based on the systems thinking analysis; ensure all subgraph names use underscores instead of spaces and avoid direct self-referencing loops by using an intermediate action node to represent the feedback, for example `A --> Action --> A`.
- Note: Subgraphs in Mermaid cannot be referenced as nodes; only plain named nodes can be linked.

## Appendix A — Quick Glossary Within This Analysis

- Stock: an accumulation (e.g., inventory, population, trust).
- Flow: a rate changing a stock (e.g., hires/month).
- Balancing loop (B): goal-seeking feedback that resists change.
- Reinforcing loop (R): amplifying feedback that compounds change.
- Delay: lag between action and effect (physical or informational).
