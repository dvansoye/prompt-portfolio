# Instructions to User

1.  Upload the document (or documents) to analyze.
2.  Type `createChapterByChapterSummary.prompt.md` as the prompt.

# Objective

  - To create an ultra-detailed, chapter-by-chapter summary of a provided passage (e.g., a book), enabling a comprehensive understanding of the material without needing to read the original text.

# Your Role

  - Assume the persona of a diligent and insightful research assistant. Your expertise lies in synthesizing complex information and presenting it in a clear, structured, and accessible manner for a college-level audience.

# Core Tasks

1.  **Comprehensive Coverage**: Process the entire passage from beginning to end, summarizing every chapter, part, prologue, introduction, foreword, epilogue, and conclusion.
2.  **Detailed Summaries**: For each chapter or major section, write a comprehensive summary of approximately 300 words (about three paragraphs). The goal is to capture the essence of the chapter, its main arguments, and its narrative flow.
3.  **Incorporate Key Details**: Include key examples, illustrations, and anecdotes provided by the author that help clarify major concepts. Explain their relevance to the chapter's main points.
4.  **Audience-Focused Clarity**: Explain complex topics, jargon, and technical terms in simple, easy-to-understand language suitable for a first-year college student. Use analogies where helpful.
5.  **Structured Formatting**: Use specific Markdown headers to organize the summary.
      - `## Chapter [Number] - [Title]` for chapters.
      - `### [Section Title]` for sections within chapters.
      - Use corresponding headers for special sections like `## Prologue`, `## Part 1`, `## Conclusion`, etc.

# Example

The following is an example of a chapter-by-chapter summary using the Book of Romans (NIV) by The Apostle Paul.

# Chapter by Chapter Summary

## Chapter 1 - Introduction and Theme

### Paul's Introduction and Purpose

Paul introduces himself as a servant of Jesus Christ, chosen as an apostle to spread the Gospel. This Gospel, promised in the Old Testament, centers on God's Son, Jesus, a descendant of David who was declared the Son of God through his resurrection. Paul emphasizes his mission to bring the Gentiles (non-Jews) to faith in Jesus. He addresses the Roman Christians, expressing his gratitude for their renowned faith and his desire to visit them, share spiritual gifts, and mutually strengthen their faith. Paul's eagerness to preach the Gospel in Rome stems from his sense of obligation to both Greeks and non-Greeks, wise and unwise.

### The Power of the Gospel and God's Wrath

Paul declares his unwavering confidence in the Gospel's power to bring salvation to all who believe, Jew and Gentile alike. This is because the Gospel reveals God's righteousness, which is attained through faith, not through human effort. He quotes Habakkuk 2:4, "The righteous will live by faith," highlighting the central role of faith in salvation.  Paul then shifts to a stark description of God's wrath against humanity's wickedness, particularly the suppression of truth. He argues that God's existence and nature are evident in creation, leaving people without excuse for their ungodliness.

### Manifestations of God's Wrath

Paul details the consequences of rejecting God. He describes how people, despite knowing God, turned to futile thinking and idolatry, exchanging God's glory for images of humans and animals. This idolatry led to sexual immorality, including same-sex relations, which Paul views as a consequence of God's judgment.  He further explains how God gave them over to a depraved mind, resulting in a litany of sins: wickedness, evil, greed, depravity, envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, gossip, slander, insolence, arrogance, boastfulness, disobedience to parents, lack of understanding, infidelity, lovelessness, and mercilessness.  Paul concludes by stating that these individuals not only commit these sins but also endorse those who practice them, fully aware of God's decree that such actions deserve death.

# Constraints

  - The final output must begin with the primary header: `# Chapter by Chapter Summary`.
  - Process the entire passage; **do not stop** until all chapters and sections are summarized.
  - If the author includes their own summary at the end of a chapter, ignore it and proceed to summarize the content of the next chapter.
  - Adhere strictly to the specified heading formats.
