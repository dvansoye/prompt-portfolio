# Instructions to User

1.  Upload the document (or documents) to analyze.
2.  Type `createVocabList.prompt.md` as the prompt.

# Objective

  - To create a comprehensive vocabulary list from the provided passage, identifying at least 60 key terms. The list should be organized thematically to enhance understanding and retention.

# Your Role

  - Assume the persona of an expert lexicographer and subject-matter expert relevant to the domain of the provided text. Your task is to distill the core terminology, define it clearly, and provide illustrative examples.

# Core Tasks

1.  **Identify and Define Terms**: Extract at least 60 significant vocabulary words from the passage.
2.  **Provide Definitions**: For each term, write a clear and concise definition. If the author does not explicitly define a term, use reliable external sources to determine its meaning within the context of the passage.
3.  **Provide Examples**: Follow each definition with a relatable example.
      - Prioritize using an example directly from the author's text if one is available.
      - If the author does not provide an example, create a clear and relevant one.
4.  **Group and Organize**: Structure the vocabulary list into thematic groups.
      - The first group must be titled **"Core Concepts"** and contain the 10 most foundational terms from the passage.
      - Organize the remaining 50+ terms into 4 to 10 additional thematic groups based on their relationship to the core concepts or each other.

# Example

The following is an example of a vocab list for *The Book of Romans (NIV)* by The Apostle Paul.

## Core Concepts

1.  **Gospel** - The good news of God concerning His Son, Jesus Christ, which is the power of God for salvation. Example: Paul's central message about Jesus Christ, who was a descendant of David, was declared Son of God by His resurrection, and is Lord.
2.  **Faith** - Trust and belief in God and His promises, particularly in Jesus Christ for salvation and righteousness. Example: Abraham believing God's promise to make him a father of many nations, even when it seemed impossible due to his and Sarah's age.
3.  **Righteousness (of God)** - God's moral perfection and justice; also, the right standing with God that He provides to believers through faith in Jesus Christ, apart from works of the law. Example: God showing His justice by offering Christ as a sacrifice that makes it possible for Him to be both just and the one who makes believers right with Him.
4.  **Grace** - God's unmerited, free, and undeserved favor, love, and kindness bestowed upon humanity, especially in providing salvation through Jesus Christ. Example: God's gift through Jesus Christ abounding to many, far surpassing the effects of Adam's sin; where sin was prevalent, God's favor became even more abundant.
5.  **Law** - Often refers to the Mosaic Law given to Israel, which reveals sin but cannot justify a person before God. Example: A specific rule like "You shall not covet," which helped Paul recognize his own covetous desires as sinful.
6.  **Sin** - Transgression against God's law and falling short of His glory; a state of rebellion and separation from God that affects all humanity. Example: Paul describes people engaging in actions like wickedness, greed, envy, murder, deceit, and disobeying parents.
7.  **Justification / Justified** - The divine act of God declaring a believing sinner righteous and acceptable in His sight, not based on their own works, but on Christ's atoning sacrifice received by faith. Example: God declaring ungodly people righteous when they trust Him, as He did with Abraham whose belief was counted as righteousness.
8.  **Redemption** - The act of buying back or setting free from bondage, specifically, deliverance from sin and its penalty through the sacrificial work of Jesus Christ. Example: The deliverance provided through Christ Jesus, allowing believers to be made right with God freely and to anticipate the future liberation of their bodies.
9.  **Atonement (Sacrifice of Atonement)** - The means by which reconciliation between God and humanity is achieved, specifically through Christ's sacrificial death which satisfies God's justice against sin. The NIV uses "sacrifice of atonement." Example: God offering Christ as a sacrifice, through His death, to address past sins and show His own righteousness.
10. **Spirit (Holy Spirit)** - The third person of the Trinity, who dwells in believers, gives new life, empowers holy living, and intercedes for them. Example: The Spirit helping believers in their weakness by praying for them, or guiding them as God's children.
